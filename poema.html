                “Grow up with me, let’s run in fields and through the dark together, fall off swings and burn special
                things, and both play outside in bad weather. Let’s eat badly, let’s watch adults drink wine and laugh
                at
                their idiocy, let’s sit in the back of the car making eye contact with strangers driving past, making
                them
                uncomfortable. Not caring, not swearing, don't fuck. Let’s both reclaim our superpowers, the ones we all
                have and lose with our milk teeth, the ability not to fear social awkwardness, to panic when locked in
                the
                cellar. Still sure there’s something down there, and while picking from pillows each feather. Let’s both
                stay away from the edge of the bed, forcing us closer together. Let’s sit in public, with ice-cream all
                over
                both our faces, sticking our tongues out at passers-by. Let’s cry, let’s swim, let’s everything. Let’s
                not
                find it funny, lest someone falls over. Classical music is boring, poetry baffles us both. There's
                nothing
                that’s said is what’s meant, plays are long, tiresome, sullen and filled with hours that could be spent
                rolling down hills and grazing our knees on cement. Let’s hear stories and both lose our innocence,
                learn
                about parents and forgiveness, death and morality, kindness and heart, thus losing both of our innocent
                hearts, but at least we wont do it apart. Grow up with me.”
                — Keaton Henson.
